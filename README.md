# Minimalist Console Website

👋 Hey there! So, here's the deal: I'm a back-end developer who *really* isn't a fan of front-end development. 🛠️ CSS and I aren't best friends 😅, but I do like creating fun stuff—and I love a good creative challenge 🎨. That's where ChatGPT comes in! 🤖✨

The idea was to build a minimalist yet interactive personal website 🖥️. Something that captures my creativity, but without all the front-end headaches. No flashy colors, just a simple, quirky terminal with some personality.

## Why This Project Exists 🤔

- 🚀 **Back-End Developer Tries Front-End**: I wanted to step a tiny bit out of my comfort zone (without too much suffering) and learn something about front-end. The goal: make it fun, keep it manageable, and let ChatGPT do the heavy lifting when I got stuck.
- 🎨 **Minimalist Design**: Because honestly, minimalism is easier on my eyes (and my sanity). Plus, I kind of love the classic terminal look.
- 💻 **Interactive Console**: It’s a fake terminal! It pretends to load things, writes cool messages like "Waiting for Rot to wake up..." with some animated dots, and looks like you're about to do something really serious. But it’s mostly for fun. 😂

## Features (If We Can Call Them That) 🤷‍♂️

- 🖥️ **Fake Terminal Prompt**: The console says `rot@spacehost:~#`, which makes it look like a Linux terminal, but really it’s just for show.
- ⏳ **Dots That Keep on Loading**: Ever wanted to see some dots endlessly cycling like they're doing something super important? Me too. This console has that.
- **Minimal UI**: No flashy JavaScript frameworks or overwhelming animations—just a terminal interface with a hint of humor.

## Running the Project 🏃‍♂️💨

1. **Clone It**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Install Stuff**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run It**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
4. **See the Magic**: Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Why I Love/Hate Front-End Now 🤷‍♀️❤️💔

- ❤️ **Love**: It turns out I *can* make something that looks cool without breaking my brain. 🎉 Thanks, ChatGPT.
- 💔 **Hate**: CSS is still not my favorite thing, but at least now I can fake it until I make it. 😆

## Future Ideas (Maybe) 💡

- 🔧 **More Fake Commands**: Make the console do more fake things, like pretending to install updates or display funny error messages.
- ⌨️ **Typing Effect for Full Messages**: Imagine it typing out entire sentences, one letter at a time—classic hacker movie style.
- 📝 **User Input**: Maybe one day, you could even type commands. That day is not today, though. 🤣
